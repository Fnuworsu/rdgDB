# rdgDB - Real-Time Distributed Graph Database

A production-grade, distributed graph database built from scratch in Go, designed for high-throughput real-time streaming data processing with strong consistency guarantees.

## Features

- 🚀 **High Performance**: Millions of operations per second through sharding and parallelization
- 🔒 **Strong Consistency**: Raft consensus for linearizable reads and writes
- 🌐 **Distributed Architecture**: Horizontal scalability with data partitioning
- 🔄 **High Availability**: Multi-replica deployment with automatic failover
- 📊 **SQL-like Query Language**: Familiar syntax with graph pattern matching
- 🧮 **Built-in Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, shortest path, PageRank, and more
- 📡 **Real-time Streaming**: Native support for continuous data ingestion
- 💻 **Interactive REPL**: Command-line interface for queries and administration

## Architecture

rdgDB is a **CP system** (Consistent and Partition-tolerant) in CAP terms:
- **Consistency**: Raft consensus ensures all replicas see the same data
- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues operating despite network partitions
- **High Availability**: Achieved through replication (typical 3-5 node clusters per shard)

### Key Components

- **Storage Engine**: In-memory graph with adjacency list representation
- **Consensus Layer**: Raft-based replication for each data shard
- **Query Engine**: SQL-inspired language with graph traversal extensions
- **Coordinator**: Metadata service for cluster topology and shard assignments
- **Streaming Ingestion**: Real-time data pipeline integration

## Project Status

🚧 **Under Active Development** 🚧

Current phase: **Phase 0 - Project Foundation**

See [task.md](/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a897bb02-cf3f-4acc-8bab-ec7f4f562310/task.md) for detailed progress.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fnuworsu/rdgDB.git
cd rdgDB

# Download dependencies
go mod download

# Run tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Build the server
go build -o bin/rdgdb-server ./cmd/server

# Build the REPL client
go build -o bin/rdgdb-repl ./cmd/repl
```

### Development Workflow

This project uses feature-based branching:

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
./scripts/branch.sh create feature/my-feature

# Make changes and write tests

# Run tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Merge when tests pass
./scripts/branch.sh merge feature/my-feature
```
